## Introduction

Driver for the Decawave [DW3000] UWB transceiver, written in the [Rust] programming language. We used the crate dw1000 developped for the [DW1000] module and changed the registers access and spi functions, added fast command and implemented some high level functions.

## Status

We tried a first positionning exemple using RTT methode. Lot of work still need to be added like the use of PDoA or AoA.

These examples uses a NUCLEO STM32F103RB

This driver is built on top of embedded-hal, which means it is portable and can be used on any platform that implements the embedded-hal API.
